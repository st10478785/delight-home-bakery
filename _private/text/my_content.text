Its the best bakery in Johannesburg! Their Olive Ciabatta bread is delicious and their pastries melt in your mouth. I stop by every weekend for my favourite breads.
Dhilan G.
Loyal Customer

The custom birthday cake I ordered for my father's party was beyond My expectation and it was both beautiful and delicious. All the guests asked where it was from!
Crisy K.
Northcliff Resident

As a person that often travels to France, I'm very particular about my croissants and pastries, but Delight Home Bakery makes their croissant evne better than some French bakerys, they are buttery, flaky perfection.
